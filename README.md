# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple text based Tic Tac Toe game where the user plays against a computer generated opponent

## Rules 

Who get first move will be determined by a coin flip if the player may pick either heads or tails 

If correctly guessed the player will be assigned the token X as their token if not they will get O and get second turn

The player will then be greeted by a board that looks like this

       
                             *       *
                         0   *  1    *   2
                             *       *   
                      -------+-------+-------
                             *       *
                         3   *   4   *   5
                             *       *
                      -------+-------+-------
                             *       *
                         6   *    7  *    8
                             *       *  
         
         
    
         
Each number corresponds to a potential position either player may make. The number the player picks during their turn will determine where their token will be placed 

Whoever gets 3 in a row will win the game
